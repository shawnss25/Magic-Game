2 Fact. I am the best in sales at my paper company. Fact. I am as strong as a bear. Fact. I have the best beet farm in the state of Pennsylvania. Fact. I have the best brain. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.

2 I played basketball in high school and now work in sales at a paper company. My coworker has a beet farm and thinks he's as strong as a bear. So this is my life. Until I win this game. Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.

2 My name is Michael Scott, and I am the Scranton branch manager at Dunder Mifflin. I don't really consider myself a part of society. I'm optimistic but everyday I get a little more desperate. Sometimes I will start a sentence and I don't even know where it's going. I don't think I understand this game. Why don't you explain this to me like I am five.
